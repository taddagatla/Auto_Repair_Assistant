## Project Scope

This platform provides vehicle diagnosis guidance, repair explanations,
and safety-oriented recommendations based on user-reported symptoms
and vehicle information.

Initial support focuses on passenger vehicles within a limited set
of manufacturers and model years.

The platform does not provide certified mechanical advice, real-time
vehicle diagnostics, remote vehicle control, or guaranteed repair outcomes.
